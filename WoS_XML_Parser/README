[Web of Science, previously known as Web of Knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_Science) "is an online subscription-based scientific citation indexing service originally produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), now maintained by Clarivate Analytics (previously the Intellectual Property and Science business of Thomson Reuters), that provides a comprehensive citation search. It gives access to multiple databases that reference cross-disciplinary research, which allows for in-depth exploration of specialized sub-fields within an academic or scientific discipline."
Web of Science data WoS data is made available as a collection of XML files. The procedure used at NETE involves splitting each XML file into smaller XML files of 20,000 records each and then feeding the split XML files to the WoS XML parser, which extracts the elements of interest and loads them into 9 csv files. These are loaded into PostgreSQL tables using a loading script in the parser.

# Welcome to NeteLabs

NETE Labs (@netelabs) at NET ESOLUTIONS CORPORATION (NETEÂ®) is a pilot research unit developing expertise in digital technologies, research analytics and business intel. NETE Labs is staffed by full-time employees of NET ESOLUTIONS Corporation (@netesolutions) who have common interests in challenging problems typically outside the immediate scope of their assigned responsibilities. These staff  volunteer their time and effort.

Several projects are active. At present, they are mostly centered around the use of administrative, bibliographic, clinical trials, and other public records to enable studies of biomedical research in particular. The work of Williams et al. (2015 Cell 163:21-23) is inspirational in this regard.

NETE Labs supports the Open Source way and makes every effort to share its code and make appropriate attribution. NETE Labs collaborates with the academic and encourages expressions of interest (email: netelabs@nete.com)

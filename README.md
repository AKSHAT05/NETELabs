# Welcome to NeteLabs

NETE Labs (@netelabs) at NET ESOLUTIONS CORPORATION (NETEÂ®) is a pilot research unit developing expertise in digital technologies, research analytics and business intel. NETE Labs is staffed by full-time employees of NETE(@netesolutions) who have common interests in challenging problems typically outside the immediate scope of their assigned responsibilities. These good folks belong to different teams within NETE and volunteer their time and effort.

Several projects are currently active. At present, they are mostly centered around the use of administrative, bibliographic, clinical trials, and other public records to enable studies of biomedical research in particular. The work of Williams et al. (2015 Cell 163:21-23) is inspirational in this regard.

In April 2017, we plan to release Python code that we wrote to parse Web of Science XML data and a version of this code has been successfully used to load the Web of Science Core Collection into a PostgreSQL 9.6 database. More on this soon...

NETE Labs supports the Open Source way and makes every effort to share its code and make appropriate attribution. Being a corporation with obligations to its customers, this isn't always possible though. NETE Labs collaborates with academia and industry. Expressions of interest in collaborations are welcomed (email: netelabs@nete.com).
